# Collatz_Conjecture

There are two aspects to this experiment:
1. check the syntax of different languages and how memory management would vary between them when working with extremely large numbers.
2. I wanted to see what the largest number I could reach was. 

I quickly figured out that python was the way to go. 

The largest number the conjecture has been proven to work for is x = 10^18. 

Python:
Largest single iteration:
x = 10^308.254715559916
time of execution = 0.024087595000000003
steps = 1381


Java:
java has a limit of "9223372036854775807" which is 10^78.79324245

Swift:
swift has a limit of "18446744073709551615", which is 10^84.44850629

Starting from 10^18 all the way to 10^19:
Figured out it was impossible to do on my 15-inch mac book pro after 6 hours I was still barely in the billions...
